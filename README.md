**8/10**

### Progress Assessment
This week has been productive, marked by the completion of the frontend. The integration of React, Redux, React Router, Axios, and Tailwind CSS resulted in a fully functional and responsive UI. However, the backend, including Django and MySQL integration, still needs work.

### Completed Components
- **Frontend**: Fully developed and functional as planned.

### Incomplete Components
- **Backend**: Needs additional work on key functionalities and MySQL integration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges

### Technical Challenges
The integration of Django with MySQL posed significant challenges, including compatibility issues and database schema migrations. Docker setup for seamless communication between services required meticulous configuration.

### Non-Technical Challenges
Remote team communication and coordination were challenging due to time zone differences. Miscommunications regarding task assignments and priorities occasionally led to delays.
